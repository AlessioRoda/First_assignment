In this repository there are two packages\+: first\+\_\+assignment and srv\+\_\+first\+\_\+assignment. The first one contains a subfolder /src in wich there is the program \hyperlink{robot__controller_8cpp}{robot\+\_\+controller.\+cpp}. It contains the publisher and the subscriber of the process to permit to the robot to move by following the position that it receives from the server.

The second package contains\+:

1) A subfolder /srv in wich there are the params that the Server requires and the params it returns 2) A subfolder /src with the \hyperlink{_server_8cpp}{Server.\+cpp} code. This code provides to generate a random position in a generic interval that it receives as an input and returns it to the /robot\+\_\+controller node.

The /stageros node provides to give the actual position of the robot by giving a topic odom, by using a nav\+\_\+msgs/\+Odometry

As it\textquotesingle{}s represented in the folowing image, that\textquotesingle{}s the way in wich nodes comunicate to eachothers.



\subsection*{How to run the code}

First of all to run the code correctly download this package inside your R\+OS workspace. Then follow the following commands inside your R\+OS workspace\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item roscore \&
\item catkin\+\_\+make
\item rosrun srv\+\_\+first\+\_\+assignment Server
\item rosrun stage\+\_\+ros stageros \$(rospack find assignment1)/world/exercise.world
\item rosrun first\+\_\+assignment robot\+\_\+controller
\end{DoxyItemize}

Then you should see the robot who moves to catch the position it receives from Server (you can see the position by having a look to the logs the /\+Server node provides).
